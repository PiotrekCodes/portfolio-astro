# Portfolio Website

# Why and What
As I needed a website to clearly shows my skills and projects, I have decided to build this portfolio website. 

# What tech
I have decided to use an Astro framework for its lightweight build size and blazing fast speeds. I only needed the static website, that's why I thought Astro will be a great choice. It is styled with vanilla CSS and deployed on Vercel. 

# WTF it doesn't work?
I was struggling to get media queries to work with Astro, I have tried to implement them in layout file, but it didn't work. I still can't make a navbar responsive, as none of me CSS selectors seem to work with it...

# What's next
Astro is great for content creators as well, I always wanted to give it a go. I might add a blog section to the portfolio in the near future.Â
